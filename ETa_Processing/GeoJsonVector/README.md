# Script to get polygons in an unaltered geojson format
- This is an altered script from ExtractVetorData.py
- It takes the same arguments and does generally the same function
  - Does not process the coordinates, but instead keeps it as a .geojson (.json)
- Currently does not write to a table but just writes to a single .json file... will need to update this
#python GeoJsonVector.py [FilePath] [Filter]
